## 📌 Problem Breakdown  
### 🔢 **Heap Insert**  
- Implements a **binary heap data structure** with insertion operations.
- Focuses on maintaining **heap property** while adding new elements.

### 🔗 **Insert in Sorted Linked List**  
- Inserts a new node in a **sorted singly linked list** while preserving order.
- Demonstrates **pointer manipulation** and edge case handling.

### ♻️ **Linked List Cycle**  
- Detects whether a **linked list contains a cycle** using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
- Implements **two-pointer technique** for cycle detection without additional space.

### 🔄 **Linked List Palindrome**  
- Determines if a **singly linked list reads the same forward and backward**.
- Uses techniques like **list reversal** and **stack-based approaches**.

### 🔐 **Lockboxes**  
- Solves the problem of determining if all boxes can be unlocked with available keys.
- Applies **graph traversal algorithms** to navigate connections between boxes.

### 📊 **Log Parsing**  
- Processes log data to extract and analyze specific metrics.
- Implements **efficient parsing techniques** for large datasets.

### 🧱 **Menger Sponge**  
- Recreates the fractal 3D cube structure in 2D representation.
- Demonstrates **recursive patterns** and geometric algorithms.

### ➕ **Minimum Operations**  
- Calculates the fewest number of operations to achieve a specific result.
- Uses **mathematical optimization** and **prime factorization**.

### 🔢 **Palindrome Integer**  
- Checks if an **integer reads the same backward as forward** without string conversion.
- Applies **mathematical digit extraction** techniques.

### 🌊 **Sandpiles**  
- Simulates the **sandpile model** where grains topple according to specific rules.
- Implements **cellular automata** concepts and grid stabilization.

### 🎮 **Slide Line**  
- Recreates the core mechanics of the 2048 game with sliding and merging.
- Focuses on **array manipulation** and **game logic**.

### ✅ **UTF-8 Validation**  
- Validates whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- Uses **bitwise operations** to check encoding compliance.
