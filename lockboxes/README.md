# Lockboxes Algorithm

## Introduction
The Lockboxes algorithm is designed to determine whether all given lockboxes can be opened given a specific set of keys contained within each box. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the goal is to unlock every box starting from the first one, which is already unlocked.

## Algorithm Description
The algorithm utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse through the boxes, starting from the first box. It uses a queue to manage the boxes to be processed and an array to keep track of which boxes have been unlocked. Each time a box is processed, the keys within are examined to unlock other boxes, adding newly unlocked boxes to the queue for further processing.

## Usage
This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where dependencies need to be resolved in a specific order to achieve a complete system unlock or initialization. Examples include:
- Initialization processes in software where modules depend on others to be initialized first.
- Puzzle games where certain tasks or levels need to be unlocked sequentially.
- Systems where resource allocation or unlocking is dependent on previous acquisitions.

## How to Run
To run the algorithm, ensure you have Python installed, then execute the script using Python 3 as follows:
```bash
python3 main_0.py
```

## Conclusion
The Lockboxes algorithm is an efficient solution for determining the accessibility of a series of dependent resources, making it suitable for various applications ranging from computer science problems to real-world logistical issues.
